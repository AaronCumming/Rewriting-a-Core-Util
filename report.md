1. What command did you implement?
I implemented the echo command.


2. What was a hurdle?
Getting the conditionals just right.  I had to rewrite them a few times and I had to get the logical 'and' correct.


3. What was easy?
Grabbing the input for the flags part with the options was easy since I had already done it before.
