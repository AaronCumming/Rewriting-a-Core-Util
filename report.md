For this assignment, your job is to pick a coreutil: https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/coreutils.html and rewrite it.

In particular, you are to:

Pick a single coreutil
Rewrite the base (no flag input) functionality without calling the original core util
Implement 2 flags available on the base core util


Your report should be a development log:



1. What command did you implement?
I implemented the echo command.


2. What was a hurdle?
Getting the conditionals just right.  I had to rewrite them a few times and I had to get the logical 'and' correct.


3. What was easy?
Grabbing the input for the flags part with the options was easy since I had already done it before.
